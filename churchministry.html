					<h2>Childrens' Ministry</h2>
					<h5>Sunday School Schedule</h5>
					<p>8:30am - 10:30am<br/>11:30am - 1:30pm</p>
					<p>Young children are notably tender;their sincerity is never in doubt and their hearts are capable of genuine conversion.In fact,Jesus told adults that they must become like children to experience the new birth(<strong><i>Matthew 18:3</i></strong>).<br/>The church that reaches out to its children has a better chance of reaching out to its adults.These children grow up to be adults who can nurture their own families to faith in Jesus Christ.<br/>We should all remember that early conversion saves not only a soul but potentially points an entire life towards service to God and man.Be the example your child can copy.</p>
