					<h4><u>BELIEFS</u></h4>
					<p>We believe that the Bible is God's Word,the product of holy men of old who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.It is accurate,authoritative and applicable to our everyday lives.</p></p>
					<p>We believe that mankind was made in the image of God.Every human personality is uniquely created,possesses dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love.</p>
					<p>We believe that sin has separated each of us from God and his purpose for  our lives.As a result,man cannot attain a right relationship with God through his own effort.</p>
					<p>We believe that Jesus Christ is the only one who can restore us to God.We believe in His virgin birth,sinless life,miracles and teachings.And that his crucifixion was in our place; the full,fitting payment for our sin.</p>
					<p>We believe that in order to receive forgiveness from God and new birth,we must repent of our sins,believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,and submit to His will for our lives.</p>

					<h4><u>CORE VALUES</u></h4>
					<h5>Christ-Centeredness</h5>
					<p><i> "He is before all things,and in him all things hold together.And he is the head of the body,the church;he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead,so that in everything he might have supremacy." <b><br>Colossians 1:17-18.</b></i></p>
					<h5>Nurturing Believers</h5>	
					<p><i> "We proclaim him,admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom,so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ." <b><br>Colossians 1:28.</b></i></p>
					<h5>God-Centered Worship and Prayer</h5> <p><i>"Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth,for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.God is spirit,and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."<b><br>John 4:23-24.</b></i></p>
					<h5>Regard for Youth and Children</h5>
					<p><i> "Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young,but set an example for the believers in speech,in life,in love,in faith and in purity"<b><br>1 Timothy 4:12.</b></i></p>
