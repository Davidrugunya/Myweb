					<h3>BAPTISM</h3>
					<p>Baptism is a picture of the death ,burial and resurrection of Christ.As you are standing in the water,it provides a picture of his life.As you are lowered into the water, it symbolizes his death.His resurrection from the dead is beautifully illustrated as you are raised up from the water.</p>
					<p>While standing in the water,you represent your old life before Christ.As you are placed below the water you will identify with Christ's sacrifice, death and burial to purchase your salvation.When you are brought up out of the water, you are raised to walk a new life with Christ as his disciple.</p>
					<p>A person should be baptised after placing their faith in the Lord for salvation.<strong>Acts 8:12</strong></p>

					<h3>CHILD DEDICATION</h3>
					<p><i> "Lo, children are a heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward."<br/><b>Psalms 127:3</b></i></p>
					<p>We don't baptize infants.However we do dedicate them to God and give them the opportunity to hear God's word every Sunday in Sunday School and someday when they recieve Jesus Christ as Saviour, we baptize them by immersion.</p>
					<p>Dedicating a child is giving that child back to God and openly declaring that: This child is a gift from God.; This child belongs to God and you are his/her custodian.; And you have the priviledge to love and care for this child.</p>
